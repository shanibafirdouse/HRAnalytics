## Project Overview:
This project focuses on creating a data analytics dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee attendance and work preferences for a company operating in a hybrid work mode. The dashboard provides valuable insights into employee presence, work from home trends, and sick leave patterns, enabling strategic decision-making for capacity planning and resource utilization.

## Project Features:
Attendance Percentage Analysis: Visualize the percentage of employees present on a weekly or monthly basis, identifying trends and fluctuations in employee attendance.

Work Preference Analysis: Analyze the work preferences of employees, distinguishing between work from home and office attendance. Explore reasons behind work from home preferences, such as specific days of the week or certain employees.

Sick Leave Tracking: Monitor sick leave patterns and identify potential reasons behind these leaves. Detect any significant spikes or trends that may require additional attention or preventive measures.

Insights for Strategic Decision-making: Leverage the gathered insights to make informed decisions regarding team building activities, team lunches, and resource allocation based on employee presence and work preferences.

Future Planning: Use the insights to enhance capacity planning efforts, optimizing the hybrid work model and reducing infrastructure costs by efficiently utilizing office space.

## Technologies Used:
Power BI: Used to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations and dashboards.
Microsoft Excel: The initial dataset was provided in Excel format, which was processed and transformed for analysis in Power BI.

## Data Source:
The project utilizes a real-life employee attendance dataset provided by the HR manager. The dataset contains employee names, randomized IDs, dates, and attendance key codes, including work from home (WFH) and sick leave (SL).
